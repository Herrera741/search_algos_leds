## BFS/DFS LEDs Arduino
 Arduino project traversing through a binary search tree of LEDs on a breadboard in depth-first-search (DFS) or breadth-first-search (BFS).

## Motivation
I started this project to build on my Arduino skills and circuits and implement the most foundational algorithms used in my classes. Plan to add HC-05 bluetooth component to breadboard and implement Bluetooth communication between custom-made Android application and Arduino board. Android application will include options to view select algorithms.
